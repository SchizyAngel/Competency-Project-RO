        <p>Having been a small child during the Beanie Baby craze in 90's I grew up loving them with my mom. I've
            created this page to show my appreciation for them,
            document their history and even sell some original Beanie Baby's I inherited from my mom. As much as I love
            these little guys I'm content appreciating them from
            afar and understand that there are collectors out there who would want them much more than I do.<br>
            I plan to eventually put up listings for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Beanie Babies released between 1994-2008</li>
            <li>Teenie Beanies released between 1997-2009</li>
            <li>Beanie Buddies released in the early 2000's</li>
            <li>Various tag protectors for collectors</li>
        </ul>
